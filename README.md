#### Description:

This app will allow one to:
- Search the OMDB database for a movie(s)
- Add movie(s) to list
- View list of movies I've seen

#### Details

- Python version Python 3.9.5
- Django version 3.2.9
- `git clone` the repository, `cd` into the folder, and open in your favorite IDE.
- It's never a bad idea to work in a virtual environment. Run `python3 -m venv env` to set one up.
- Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies (in your activated virtual environment)
- To run this app, locally, run `python manage.py runserver` and navigate to `localhost:8000`

#### Future features

- Pagination
- Search db prior to making api call (so as not to hit API)
- Write some tests (pytest)
